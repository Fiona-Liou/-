# Mind-Healing Playlist  
Analyzing mental health states and matching them to music genres to create personalized playlists.

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between mental health states and music genres.  
By reclassifying mental states using clustering techniques and analyzing 30,000 Spotify songs, we aim to generate a **personalized “mind-healing” playlist** tailored to emotional needs.

## Content
- **Reclassification of mental states** using K-means clustering.  
- **Mapping mental states to music genres** through heatmap visualization.  
- **Analyzing music attributes** using frequency distribution plots across a large Spotify dataset.

## Tools & Languages
- **R** – Data analysis, visualization (ggplot2, heatmap)  
- **Excel** – Data preprocessing and cleaning

## Models & Methods
- K-means clustering  
- Heatmap visualization  
- Distribution plots (frequency analysis)

## Future Directions
- Integrating a recommendation algorithm for playlist generation  
- Expanding to more nuanced emotional categories  
- Deploying an interactive dashboard
